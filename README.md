# Grad-School-Acceptance-Prediction
### Predicting and analyzing factors in graduate school acceptance.

This project reports on two models (KNN & SVM) used for predicting the likelihood of acceptance into a Master’s program-of-interest given a certain applicant “profile.” The considerations made when developing these models, the model performance evaluation, and the conclusions derived from the performances of said models. The answer to the proposed research question will inspire many aspiring graduate students to apply for only the programs at which they have the greatest chances of admission (given their applicant profile), and thus, saving time, effort, and of course, money.

The dataset was obtained from kaggle.com. The full project is decribed in detail in the Wiki section.

Project implemented in R and R-studio.
